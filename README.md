# Before you start
Set your preferences by opening the Openplanet Menu and navigating to `Openlanet -> Settings` and then selecting `Unique Replay Name`.
Here you can set up the replay name and the counter. Please be aware that the replay name and the counter are only allowed to have 10 characters in total.

# Features
- hit `S` (or your custom hotkey for saving replays) to automatically set a unique replay name.
- Set a replay name and use a counter that ticks up every time you save a replay.
