# Before you start
Set your preferences via `Scripts -> Unique Replay Name`. In this window, you can toggle replay name replacements, and set your preferred replacement mode. If counting mode is activated, additional options appear.

Please set your replay name and the counter *before* starting to record replays because the settings don't save yet.

# Features
- hit `S` (or your custom hotkey for saving replays) to automatically set a unique replay name.
- choose between two modes:
    - **Counting Mode:** Set a replay name and use a counter that ticks up every time you save a replay with this method.
    - **Time Mode:** Adds the current time to the replay name
- No saving yet
